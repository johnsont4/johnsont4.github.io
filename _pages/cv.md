Education
======
* B.A. in Computer Science & Statistics, [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/news/stories/carleton-moves-up-us-news-world-report-best-colleges-rankings/), 2023

Research experience
======
* **Research Assistant** - *[UCLA RIPS REU](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2023-los-angeles/) - Los Angeles, CA*
  * Worked with the [Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)](https://www.afrl.af.mil/) to replace high-fidelity models that simulate the flow of supersonic air over a wedge with a faster, comparably accurate multi-fidelity model.
  * Presented our work at the 2024 [Join Mathematics Meetings](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2024/2300_program.html).
  * Check out [our paper](https://pdf.ac/2UqkOB) for more details.

* **Research Assistant** - *Carleton College - Northfield, MN*
  * Implemented a loss function that prioritizes fairness using a counterfactual fairness metric and a counterfactual data augmentation method that mitigates bias in toxicity classification.
  * Check out [our paper](https://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/2223/replication/final-results-chenj3/resources.html) for more details.

* **Research Assistant** - *Carleton College - Northfield, MN*
  * Determined that scagnostics, a set of graphical measures created in 2007, are up to 80% more effective at determining the fit of a model than classic statistics such as the variance and mean when used in conjunction with random forest, generalized additive, and support vector models.
  * Won first place in the [2023 USRESP undersgraduate statistics research competition](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/usresp/2023/spring/winners) and presented at the [2023 Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference](https://www.causeweb.org/usproc/eusr/2023).
  * Check out [our paper](https://pdf.ac/1tJQGp) for more details.

* **Research Assistant** - *Carleton College - Northfield, MN*
  * Developed an educational programming game using ReactJS and Typescript that studies how students learn coding concepts.
  * [Play the game](https://awilliambauer.github.io/dragon-architect-2/) and check out our [code](https://github.com/awb-carleton/dragon-architect-2).

Professional experience
======
* **ML Engineer** - *[General Motors](https://www.gm.com/) - Austin, TX*
  * Designing and implementing generative AI pipelines. Pipelines include a supply chain chat bot, a summarization model, and a risk identification pipeline.
  
* **Software Engineer Intern** - *[National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) - Boulder, CO*
  * Developed a new search engine for NCAR using Spring Boot that enables scientists to efficiently find scientific resources produced by each of NCARâ€™s seven research labs.
