Hi there, welcome to my website! Currently I'm a ML engineer at [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/) where I create and deploy generative AI pipelines that help supply chain teams across GM. In the past, I've conducted research on [NLP fairness](https://cs.carleton.edu/cs_comps/2223/replication/final-results-chenj3/resources.html), [computational fluid dynamics](https://pdf.ac/2UqkOB), and [statistical graphics processing](https://www.pdffiller.com/jsfiller-desk19/?isShareViaLink=1&requestHash=1cc9931eb95ade9336e5f0bf4795f9c50f0a463e26ead2dca38f59802533548a&lang=en&projectId=1292057037&loader=tips&jsfiller_preauth_hash=7ad8fcc766c649b4aa0d131b965b481f&MEDIUM_PDFJS=true&PAGE_REARRANGE_V2_MVP=true&isPageRearrangeV2MVP=true&jsf-page-rearrange-v2=true&jsf-new-header=false&routeId=3781b4aee8ff7ea58241531ee5b1a0fc). I'm a NLP enthusiast and love keeping up with the latest groundbreaking NLP models. I'm looking forward to applying to Ph.D. programs this fall and continuing my journey as a NLP researcher!

**Research interests:** I am passionate about improving the robustness, fairness and efficiency of NLP systems. I am particularly excited about applications in areas related to person-centered healthcare, cultural analysis, LLM ethics, and low-resource domains.
