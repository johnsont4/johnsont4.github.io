Hello, welcome to my personal website! I'm a NLP enthusiast and love keeping up with the latest groundbreaking NLP models. Currently I'm a ML engineer at [General Motors](https://www.gm.com/) where I create and deploy NLP models that help supply chain business teams. Currently our team is implementing numerous generative language models to help with various supply chain tasks. I'm looking forward to applying to Ph.D. programs this fall and continue my journey as an NLP researcher!

**Research interests:** I am passionate about improving the robustness and fairness of NLP systems, with a focus on mitigating bias, developing reliable evaluation metrics for text generation, and improving out-of-distribution generalization. I am particularly excited about applications in areas related to person-centered healthcare, cultural analysis, LLM ethics, and narrative detection.
